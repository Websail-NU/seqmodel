# Sequence Model (Work-In-Progress)

A code base for creating and running sequence models of language. Including
both language models and encoder-decoder models.

## TODO
- Refactor dropout (replace static values of `keep_prob` with placeholders).
- Simplify sampling interfaces.
- Load best model to evaluate when the training is done
